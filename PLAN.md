## Split one-time Gate 0 setup steps out of CLAUDE.md into SETUP.md (2026-08-27)

### Decision

- Ported the SETUP.md split from the EN template repo (`ai-driven-development-setting-files-en`) into this JP repo. `CLAUDE.md`'s Gate 0 Step 1-4 section (frontend stack selection, ai-context fill-in, requirements docs, architecture design, TDD pipeline diagram) was moved verbatim (translated to Japanese) into a new top-level `SETUP.md`, read once at project kickoff. `CLAUDE.md` now only keeps a short pointer to it plus the steady-state per-session rules.
- Cross-references to `CLAUDE.md`'s Step 1-4 procedure were repointed to `SETUP.md` in `.claude/rules/00-global.md`, `.claude/rules/60-docs.md`, `meta/adr/ADR-0005-frontend-stack.md`, and `README.md`. `AGENTS.md` was left unchanged, matching the EN repo's treatment (it never duplicated the Step 1-4 procedure).
- Also added `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto`) and a `.gitignore` entry for `.claude/settings.local.json`, mirroring the EN repo's changes, to stop line-ending diff noise and personal local settings from being tracked.

### Files touched

`SETUP.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/00-global.md`, `.claude/rules/60-docs.md`, `meta/adr/ADR-0005-frontend-stack.md`, `README.md`, `.gitattributes` (new), `.gitignore`.

### Status

Completed. No open follow-ups.

## Separate template/harness ADRs from project ADRs (2026-08-15)

### Decision

- `docs/adr/` is reserved exclusively for the ADRs of the project built from this template. It now starts empty; the first project ADR should be `ADR-0001`.
- The 9 ADRs that document this template/harness's own design (ADR-0001 through ADR-0009) were moved to `meta/adr/`, a new top-level directory outside `docs/`. This keeps them out of any future "reset project docs" sweep of `docs/`, and out of the project's own ADR numbering sequence.
- All cross-references to these 9 files (in `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `docs/ai-context/`, `docs/architecture/`, `docs/development/`) were repointed to `meta/adr/`. References to `docs/adr/` that describe creating a *new* project ADR (e.g. `/adr` command, `CLAUDE.md` Step 1a/3, Gate rules) were left unchanged.
- Added `docs/adr/README.md` and `meta/adr/README.md` explaining the split so it isn't rediscovered by accident later.

### Files touched

`meta/adr/ADR-0001` through `ADR-0009` (moved from `docs/adr/`), `docs/adr/README.md` (new), `meta/adr/README.md` (new), `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/rules/00-global.md`, `.claude/rules/15-frontend.md`, `.claude/rules/30-testing.md`, `.claude/rules/31-e2e-testing.md`, `.claude/rules/50-review.md`, `docs/ai-context/common-commands.md`, `docs/ai-context/module-map.md`, `docs/development/ai-workflow.md`, `docs/architecture/authz-authn.md`.

### Status

Completed. No open follow-ups.

## Frontend stack selection process built into Gate 0 (2026-08-03)

### Decision

- `docs/adr/ADR-0005-frontend-stack.md` was changed from a fixed decision (Vue 3 + Inertia.js + Pinia for all projects) to a per-project selection framework within the PHP/Laravel ecosystem (Blade / Livewire / Vue+Inertia+Pinia / React+Inertia / SPA+API), with Vue+Inertia+Pinia kept as the default recommendation.
- The selection process is now an explicit part of Gate 0 (`CLAUDE.md` Step 1a/1b/1c): select stack → record a project ADR via `/adr` → rewrite `.claude/rules/15-frontend.md` for the chosen stack → reflect the result in `docs/ai-context/`.
- `.claude/rules/15-vue.md` was renamed to `.claude/rules/15-frontend.md` so the rule file path stays stable regardless of which stack is selected — projects choosing a non-default stack rewrite this file's contents instead of creating a new file and updating every cross-reference.
- Backend (Laravel + MySQL, ADR-0001/0002) and auth strategy (Sanctum + Policy/Gate, ADR-0003) remain fixed template decisions — out of scope for this flexibility.

### Files touched

`docs/adr/ADR-0005-frontend-stack.md`, `docs/adr/ADR-0006-e2e-testing-playwright.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `.claude/rules/00-global.md`, `.claude/rules/15-frontend.md` (renamed from `15-vue.md`), `.claude/rules/30-testing.md`, `.claude/rules/50-review.md`, `.claude/rules/60-docs.md`, `.claude/agents/tdd-implementer.md`, `docs/ai-context/module-map.md`.

### Status

Completed. No open follow-ups.
